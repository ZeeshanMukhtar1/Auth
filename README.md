# MERN Stack Auth App Boilerplate

## Overview

This MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack authentication app serves as a comprehensive boilerplate for building full-stack applications with user authentication. It provides a foundation for manual user creation with email and password, as well as an option to continue with Google authentication. The frontend is developed using React with Redux for state management, while the backend is built with Express, employing MongoDB as the database. The styling is implemented with Tailwind CSS, and React Router handles the routing.

## Getting Started

Create a `.env` in `server` and `client` and add required environment variables.
`.env.sample` file in both `server` and `client` can be used as a reference.

## Features

- User authentication with email and password
- Google authentication integration
- Redux for efficient state management
- Tailwind CSS for responsive and sleek UI
- Easy customization for your specific project requirements

We welcome contributions to improve and enhance the boilerplate. If you have any suggestions, bug fixes, or feature additions, feel free to submit a pull request. Don't forget to give the repository a star if you find it helpful!
